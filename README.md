SafeSpeak AI
This project is a real-time and uploaded video transcription system that captures speech, converts it into text, and performs sentiment analysis while detecting abusive and bad words. The system integrates speech recognition, text processing, and computer vision to provide an interactive interface where users can:

Transcribe speech in real-time from a live video feed with overlaid text and sentiment analysis.
Upload pre-recorded videos, extract speech, and analyze the transcription for sentiment and abusive language detection.
